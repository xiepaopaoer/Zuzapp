# Zuzapp
# Context and Background.
Zuzapp was born out of the passion for **continuity of Zuzalu community**, and is the operation to build the Zuzalu software, infra and application for our community and every community out there that doesn't even exist yet. Backed by **ECF** and **Zuzalu core**, it will be a platform that realizes:
  - **Online & offline gatherings,**
  - **Coordinations,**
  - **In-person interactions,**
  - **Empowerment for communities to spin up.**

# Vision & approach.
As a **community-owned project**, Zuzapp proudly emerges as the next chapter of Zuzalu. It serves as a hub by: 
  - **Showcasing a diverse range of Zuzalu-aligned projects,**
  - **Offering a comprehensive toolkit for community coordination,**
  - **Providing a scalable and versatile infrastructue for any communities from ground up to integrate.**

# Call to Action-invitation to co-build.
Zuzapp thrives on the collective spirit of individuals who share Zuzalu vision, eagerly awaiting enthusiastic members to contribute and help take on challenges, research on problems and build new exciting features. Currently, we have more than 30 members in the workspace researching and building the software together. It is in need of contributors to lead engaging discussions to turn research into tangible outcomes.
